## HTTP Transport & Deployment

The server supports two transport modes:

| Mode | Activation | Use case |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **stdio** (default) | `npx polymarket-trader-mcp` | Claude Code, Cursor, local MCP clients |
| **HTTP** | `--http` flag or `PORT` env var | Smithery, Railway, Docker, remote hosting |

### Starting in HTTP mode

```bash
# Flag
node dist/index.js --http

# Or set PORT (defaults to 3000)
PORT=8080 node dist/index.js
```

### Endpoints

| Path | Method | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `/mcp` | POST | MCP protocol endpoint (Streamable HTTP transport) |
| `/health` | GET | Health check — returns `{ status, version, db }` |
| `/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json` | GET | Server discovery card for Smithery |
| `/` | GET | Server info with version and endpoint list |

### Authentication

Set `MCP_API_KEY` to require Bearer token auth on the `/mcp` endpoint:

```bash
MCP_API_KEY=my-secret-key node dist/index.js --http
# Clients must send: Authorization: Bearer my-secret-key
```

When `MCP_API_KEY` is not set, the `/mcp` endpoint is open (suitable for local/private networks).

### Docker deployment

The included `Dockerfile` builds a multi-stage production image that runs in HTTP mode:

```bash
docker build -t polymarket-mcp .
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v mcp-data:/app/data \
  -e MCP_API_KEY=my-secret-key \
  -e DAILY_BUDGET=50 \
  polymarket-mcp
```

`DB_PATH` (default `/app/data/copytrader.db`) controls where SQLite data is persisted — mount a volume to keep it across restarts.

## Configuration

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|

| `MIN_CONVICTION` | No | `3` | Min trade size to copy ($) |
