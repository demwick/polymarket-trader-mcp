## HTTP Transport & Deployment

The server supports two transport modes:

| Mode | Activation | Use case |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **stdio** (default) | `npx polymarket-agent-mcp` | Claude Code, Cursor, local MCP clients |
| **HTTP** | `--http` flag or `PORT` env var | Self-hosted Docker, private VPS, single-user remote |

### Deployment model — read this first

This server is designed for **single-tenant use**. Each client runs its own instance with its own SQLite database (`copytrader.db`), watchlist, daily budget, trade history, and monitor loop. The stdio mode is the recommended path for most users — `npx polymarket-agent-mcp` or the Claude Code config above gives you a fully isolated, local-only instance.

> ⚠️ **Do not expose an HTTP instance publicly.** The server has no per-user isolation: watchlist, positions, budget, and the background monitor loop are shared across every client that connects. A public HTTP deployment is effectively a shared workspace, not a multi-tenant SaaS. If you enable live trading, a public endpoint can drain your Polymarket wallet from any caller. Always configure the HTTP bearer-token env var (see [PERMISSIONS.md](PERMISSIONS.md)) and keep the endpoint behind a firewall, VPN, or auth proxy.

### Starting in HTTP mode

```bash
# Flag
node dist/index.js --http

# Or set PORT (defaults to 3000)
PORT=8080 node dist/index.js
```

### Endpoints

| Path | Method | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `/mcp` | POST | MCP protocol endpoint (Streamable HTTP transport) |
| `/health` | GET | Health check — returns `{ status, version, db }` |
| `/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json` | GET | Server discovery card for Smithery |
| `/` | GET | Server info with version and endpoint list |

### Authentication

The HTTP transport accepts an optional bearer token gated by an environment variable — the exact name is documented in [PERMISSIONS.md](PERMISSIONS.md). When set, clients must send `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on requests to `/mcp`; when unset the endpoint is open (suitable only for local or private networks).

### Docker deployment

The included `Dockerfile` builds a multi-stage production image that runs in HTTP mode:

```bash
docker build -t polymarket-mcp .
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v mcp-data:/app/data \
  -e DAILY_BUDGET=50 \
  polymarket-mcp
# To require bearer-token auth on /mcp, also pass the HTTP bearer env var
# listed in PERMISSIONS.md (e.g. `-e <VAR>=my-secret-key`).
```

`DB_PATH` (default `/app/data/copytrader.db`) controls where SQLite data is persisted — mount a volume to keep it across restarts.

---

## Configuration

All secrets stay in memory for the lifetime of the process — they are **never** written to the database, logs, or disk, and are only transmitted to their designated Polymarket API endpoint over HTTPS. The complete authoritative env var list, with per-variable sensitivity and scope, lives in **[PERMISSIONS.md](PERMISSIONS.md)** and **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)**.

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `COPY_MODE` | No | `preview` | `preview` (simulated) or `live` (real orders) |
| `DAILY_BUDGET` | No | `20` | Max daily spend in USDC |
| `MIN_CONVICTION` | No | `3` | Min trade size to copy ($) |
| Wallet signing key | Live only | - | Locally signs CLOB order payloads, never persisted (see PERMISSIONS.md for exact env var name) |
| CLOB API credentials | Live only | - | API key / secret / passphrase — sent only to `clob.polymarket.com` (see PERMISSIONS.md for exact names) |

## Permissions & Capabilities

This package has a transparent, minimal footprint. Full disclosure: **[PERMISSIONS.md](PERMISSIONS.md)** — machine-readable version in [`.well-known/mcp/server-card.json`](.well-known/mcp/server-card.json).

| Category | Scope |
|----------|-------|
| **Network (outbound)** | 3 Polymarket HTTPS APIs + 1 inbound-only WSS public price stream (`ws-subscriptions-clob.polymarket.com`) + optional license check (`mcp-marketplace.io`) |
| **Filesystem** | Single SQLite database file + `.env` read at startup — nothing else |
| **Environment** | API credentials (live mode only, in memory only), budget config, mode selection |
| **Processes** | None — no child processes, no shell commands, no `eval`/`Function` |
| **Telemetry** | None — no analytics, no crash reports, no update checks, no third-party data flow |

**WebSocket scope:** The WSS connection to Polymarket is **inbound-only** for public price updates. No wallet, credential, or user identity is transmitted — it carries the same public feed available to any browser client.

**Secrets scope:** Every secret environment variable is held in memory only, never logged, never persisted, and sent to exactly one host (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#data-handling--secrets)).
