## Scope

This project is an MCP server for Polymarket trading. Security-relevant areas include:

- **API credential handling** — wallet private keys, API tokens
- **Trade execution** — order placement, position management
- **Database** — SQLite storage of trade history, configuration
- **Input validation** — all MCP tool inputs are validated via Zod schemas

## Data Handling & Secrets

`polymarket-trader-mcp` is designed to run as a single-tenant local process. The following guarantees are enforced by the codebase and are the standard this project holds itself to:

### Secrets

- **`POLY_PRIVATE_KEY`** is the Polymarket wallet private key. It is loaded from the environment at startup into the validated config singleton and is used **only** to locally sign EIP-712 CLOB order payloads. It is:
  - Never written to the SQLite database
  - Never written to any file on disk
  - Never written to logs (stdout or stderr)
  - Never transmitted anywhere except as part of the signed order payload sent to `clob.polymarket.com` over HTTPS
  - Held exclusively in process memory for the lifetime of the server
- **`POLY_API_KEY`**, **`POLY_API_SECRET`**, **`POLY_API_PASSPHRASE`**, and **`MCP_LICENSE_KEY`** follow the same five-rule policy: in memory only, never logged, never persisted, single destination, scrubbed from error messages.
- There is no code path that serializes the validated config object to disk, a log sink, or an outbound HTTP body other than the designated endpoints.

### Network

Only five hosts are ever contacted:

1. `data-api.polymarket.com` (HTTPS, read-only)
2. `gamma-api.polymarket.com` (HTTPS, read-only)
3. `clob.polymarket.com` (HTTPS, reads + signed order writes in live mode)
4. `ws-subscriptions-clob.polymarket.com` (WSS, inbound-only public price stream)
5. `mcp-marketplace.io` (HTTPS, optional one-time license verification)

There is no analytics, telemetry, crash reporting, or update-check traffic. The WebSocket connection is purely inbound — it subscribes to Polymarket's public price feed and receives updates; no wallet or credential is transmitted. See [PERMISSIONS.md](./PERMISSIONS.md) for the complete manifest.

### Storage

The SQLite database (`./copytrader.db` by default, overridable via `DB_PATH`) stores only watchlists, trade records, budget usage, and user-set configuration. It contains **no** credentials, **no** PII, and **no** data that is not already public on-chain.

### Default Mode

The server starts in `COPY_MODE=preview` by default. In preview mode, trades are recorded in the local database as simulations and **no** request is ever signed or sent to the CLOB trading endpoint. Live trading requires an explicit `COPY_MODE=live` plus all four `POLY_*` secrets.

## Trust Boundary

This package is designed for **single-tenant** use — one operator, one wallet, one local process. It is explicitly **not** designed to be hosted as a multi-user service. The optional HTTP transport (`MCP_API_KEY` bearer auth) is intended for trusted private deployments only. See the README for the full deployment warning.

## Best Practices for Users

- Never commit `.env` files or API keys to version control
- Use `COPY_MODE=preview` (default) until you've verified your configuration
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Store `POLY_PRIVATE_KEY` in a dedicated secrets manager (1Password, `pass`, `macOS` keychain) — not in a shell profile
- Set `DAILY_BUDGET` conservatively while evaluating copy targets
- Run the server on a machine whose full disk is encrypted
- Review [PERMISSIONS.md](./PERMISSIONS.md) before enabling live mode
